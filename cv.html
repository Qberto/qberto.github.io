            This map service shows the dominant lifestyle segment in an area in 2012, based on <a href="https://www.esri.com/data/esri_data">Esri's Tapestry Segmentation system</a>. The map displays the dominant segment's LifeMode summary group color. The "dominant" segment is most useful at tract and block group levels.<br><br> 

            Tapestry Segmentation, Esri's geodemographic market segmentation system, classifies U.S. neighborhoods into <a href="http://www.esri.com/library/fliers/pdfs/tapestry_segmentation.pdf">65 segments</a> based on their socioeconomic and demographic composition. For a broader view of markets, segments are grouped into 12 LifeMode Summary Groups that reflect lifestyles/life stages and 11 Urbanization Summary Groups that show levels of affluence and population density.

        <p>
            This map service summarizes racial and ethnic diversity in the United States in 2012. The Diversity Index shows the likelihood that two persons chosen at random from the same area, belong to different race or ethnic groups. The index ranges from 0 (no diversity) to 100 (complete diversity). Diversity in the U.S. population is increasing. The diversity score for the entire United States in 2012 is 61.<br><br>

            The data shown is from <a href="http://www.esri.com/data/esri_data">Esri's 2012 Updated Demographics</a>. The map adds increasing level of detail as you zoom in, from state, to county, to ZIP Code, to tract, to block group data. This map shows Esri's 2012 estimates using Census 2010 geographies.
